# DCZia 2019 Badge Build Guide

Rough draft of build guide

## Parts List

The following parts should be included with your badge:

- Partially asasembled badge PCB
- 5x Mechanical "low profile" Keyswitches
- 5x keycaps
- 1 OLED Screen
- 1 Rotary Encoder
- 1 Speaker
- 1 Battery Box
- 3x AAA Batteries
- 2x SAO Headers
- Please note, no SD card is included, this is optional
- Stickers
- Lanyard

## Build Instructions

- Step 1. Solder on keyswitches
- Step 2. Solder on rotatry encoder
- Step 3. Solder on battery box
  - **Note** If you did solder on the battery box first, genly bend it upwards to access the components you need to solder underneath it.
- Step 4. Attach screen
  - **Note** Mount the header to the board putting the long legs through the four holes from the back of the pcb. The black plastic part of the header should lay flat on the back of the pcb. Solder the display to the long legs from the front, this way the screen will lay flat on the font of the pcb.
- Step 5. Attach SAO Headers
  - If you wish to use SAO's solder the two headers to the front of the pcb with the notch pointing up
- Step 6. Attach Speaker
  - The positive (RED) and negative (BLACK) wires of the speaker get soldered to the two square pads on the back of the badge on the left side of the pcb looking at it from the rear. Then take the sticky tape backing off the speaker and attach it centered on the prefroated holes on the back of the board.
- Step 7. Cut the DCZIA sticker and trim into individual D C Z I A stickers and place on the keycaps
- Step 8. Install Batteries

-- NOTE - The headphone jack does not work as is,we will post a fix. The jack did not match the footprint we used. Sorry!
-- Also Note, if your speaker is really really quiet, please contact us.

## Badge User Manual

The badge by default boots into LED Mode. Presing the D C Z I A keys will change the key light patterns, and colors of the top RGB leds. Placing your hands 2 - 25 cm above the left and right sides of the badge will modify the brightness and color of the corresponding LEDs.

Pressing down on the top of the rotary encoder (it will click when you have activated the button) will change sound modes. The main modes will be LED Mode, Theramin Mode, and Fixed Volume Mode (Loud Mode). 

Looking at the front of the badge with the screen at the top, the left distance sensor will affect volume, and the right sensor will change pitch. Pressing the keys will change waveforms (Square Wave, Sine Wave, Triangle Wave, Sawtooth, and PWM). Rotating the rotary encoder will change the range of pitch that the right sensor will modify.
